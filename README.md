# AI primer

- (2019.09.03) - get to know and introduction to Linear Algebra and Singular Value Decomposition and couple of it's use cases. 
- (2019.09.10) - set up conda enviroment and try to play with provided Jupyter Notebooks. Your focus should go to get better understanding of tools (git, anaconda and jupyter) and packages (numpy, pandas and matplotlib).
- (2019.09.17) - go through *Boston dataset (simple end-to-end).ipynb* and complete exercises. We will talk about Linear Regression and Generalized Linear Models (like Lasso).

## Installation instructions

To make sure that notebooks run fluently use either [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker) or install [conda](https://anaconda.org/) and launch `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

Installation steps:
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)
- Opend Anaconda Prompt or shell if you are on linux
- cd to your Desktop
- git clone https://github.com/trokas/ai_primer.git
- cd ai_primer
- conda env create -f environment.yml
- conda activate ai_primer
- jupyter notebook
